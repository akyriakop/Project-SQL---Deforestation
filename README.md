## Project-SQL---Deforestation

ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.
The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.

1. GLOBAL SITUATION
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was ____41,282,694.9______________ in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to ______39,958,245.9____________, a loss of ___________1,324,449_sqkm______, or _______-3,20824___________%.
The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of _____PERU_____________ listed for the year 2016 (which is ___44,449.01 sqm_km_______________).
2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK
In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was ___31.38%_______________. The region with the highest relative forestation was____ Latin America & Caribbean______________, with _____46.16_____________%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was ____ Middle East & North Africa______________, with _____2.07_____________% forestation.
In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was __________________. The region with the highest relative forestation was_____ Latin America & Caribbean_____________, with _______51.03___________%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was _______ Middle East & North Africa___________, with ________ 1.78__________% forestation.

31.38
The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were ___ Latin America & Caribbean_______________ (dropped from __51.03________________% to ________46.16__________%) and ________ Sub-Saharan Africa__________ (_______30.67___________% to ______28.79____________%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large, the percent forest area of the world decreased over this time period from ________32.42__________% to ________31.38__________%.
3. COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL
A. SUCCESS STORIES
There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, ____China______________. This country actually increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by __ 527229.062 sqkm_______________. It would be interesting to study what has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. The country with the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the___United States_______________, but it only saw an increase of ____79200 sqkm______________, much lower than the figure for ___from China??? ( I don’t understand)______________.
____ China ______________ and ____ United States ______________ are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look at the largest percent change in forest area from 1990 to 2016, we aren’t surprised to find a much smaller country listed at the top. ____ Iceland ______________ increased in forest area by ______2.1366458887____________% from 1990 to 2016.
B. LARGEST CONCERNS
Which countries are seeing deforestation to the largest degree? We can answer this question in two ways. First, we can look at the absolute square kilometer decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. The following 3 countries had the largest decrease in forest area over the time period under consideration:
Table 3.1: Top 5 Amount Decrease in Forest Area by Country, 1990 & 2016:
Country
Region
Absolute Forest Area Change
Brazil
Latin America & Caribbean
541510
Indonesia
East Asia & Pacific
282193.9844
Myanmar
East Asia & Pacific
107234.0039
Nigeria
Sub-Saharan Africa
106506.00098
Tanzania
Sub-Saharan Africa
102320
The second way to consider which countries are of concern is to analyze the data by percent decrease.
Table 3.2: Top 5 Percent Decrease in Forest Area by Country, 1990 & 2016:
Country
Region
Pct Forest Area Change
Togo
Sub-Saharan Africa
3.07
Nigeria
Sub-Saharan Africa
1.62
Uganda
Sub-Saharan Africa
1.45
Mauritania
Sub-Saharan Africa
0.88
Honduras
Latin America & Caribbean
0.82
When we consider countries that decreased in forest area the most between 1990 and 2016, we find that four of the top 5 countries on the list are in the region of _____ Sub-Saharan Africa _____________. The countries are ____ Togo ______________, ______ Nigeria ____________, ____ Uganda ______________, and _____ Mauritania _____________. The
5th country on the list is _______ Honduras ___________, which is in the ______ Latin America & Caribbean ____________ region.
From the above analysis, we see that _______ Nigeria ___________ is the only country that ranks in the top 5 both in terms of absolute square kilometer decrease in forest as well as percent decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. Therefore, this country has a significant opportunity ahead to stop the decline and hopefully spearhead remedial efforts.
C. QUARTILES

The largest number of countries in 2016 were found in the ____0-25______________ quartile.
There were _____85_____________ countries in the top quartile in 2016. These are countries with a very high percentage of their land area designated as forest. The following is a list of countries and their respective forest land, denoted as a percentage.
